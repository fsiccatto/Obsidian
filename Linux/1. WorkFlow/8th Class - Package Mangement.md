Packages are archives that contain binaries of software, configuration files, information about dependencies and keep track of updates and upgrades. The features that most package management systems provide are:
- Package downloading
- Dependency resolution
- A standard binary package format
- Common installation and configuration locations
- Additional system-related configuration and functionality
- Quality control

If an installed software has been deleted, the package management system then retakes the package's information, modifies it based on its configuration, and deletes files. There are different package management programs that we can use for this. Here is a list of examples of such programs:

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dpkg`|The `dpkg` is a tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for `dpkg` is aptitude.|
|`apt`|Apt provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system.|
|`aptitude`|Aptitude is an alternative to apt and is a high-level interface to the package manager.|
|`snap`|Install, configure, refresh, and remove snap packages. Snaps enable the secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for the cloud, servers, desktops, and the internet of things.|
|`gem`|Gem is the front-end to RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby.|
|`pip`|Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation.|
|`git`|Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.|
